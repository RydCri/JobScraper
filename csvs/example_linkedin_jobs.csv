Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

Netflix has been on the leading edge of the cloud since beginning the migration to AWS 15 years ago and runs one of the largest Cloud footprints around. The Cloud Engineering organization exists to manage that massive scale, constantly innovating to increase fleet-wide agility, efficiency, and reliability of the Netflix cloud infrastructure, while solving scale problems that we are the first to ever hit. We build, operate, and maintain Compute, Network, and Storage services so that developers at Netflix can rely on foundational building blocks when entertaining hundreds of millions of customers around the world. Join us as we push the boundaries of performance and resilience, empowering developers to create groundbreaking applications on a reliable platform.

We are looking to add new stunning colleagues to the organization, driving the transformation of how most Netflix engineers set up, change, or otherwise interact with their service infrastructure. You will partner across teams and functions to drive the next evolutionary stage of some of our most beloved and used UIs, like Spinnaker. Your work will enable us to evolve blueprints of highly efficient and fast-to-iterate services tailored to various product areas within the company, abstracting our developers from the nuances of the underlying infrastructure.

















Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range.

Full-time salaried employees are immediately entitled to flexible time off. See more detail about our Benefits here.

Inclusion is a Netflix value and we strive to host a meaningful interview experience for all candidates. If you want an accommodation/adjustment for a disability or any other reason during the hiring process, please send a request to your recruiting partner.

We are an equal-opportunity employer and celebrate diversity, recognizing that diversity builds stronger teams. We approach diversity and inclusion seriously and thoughtfully. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, age, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic makeup, marital status, or military service."

We're looking for an experienced frontend engineer. We want someone with programming (and ideally also design) chops who can own the frontend and take our product to the next level as we scale.

We're building a PaaS that runs in a user's own cloud (basically Heroku on k8s) and we've converted some of Heroku's largest enterprise users as well as a large base of high-growth startups despite starting just a little over a year ago.

Now that we're hitting our stride, we're focused on capturing as much mindshare as possible, so we need someone who can take the polish and devX of our PaaS to the next level.

This role would involve maximum ownership. Our entire engineering team is currently full-stack (leaning backend) or on infra side. I (Justin) do most of the day-to-day FE/UX work as a founder, so we want someone with more experience who can do it worlds better.







Porter is open source. You can view our entire codebase here: https://github.com/porter-dev/porter.
