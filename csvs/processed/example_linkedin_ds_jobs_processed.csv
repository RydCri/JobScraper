We are hiring a Front-End Web Developer to help build, optimize, and maintain our web applications.

You will contribute to our core codebase, documentation, and Front-End architecture, ensuring usability, accessibility, and performance. What’s in a title?

Here at Two Barrels we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fairly traditional way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we’ve realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths and professional goals. Once you join our team the titles kinda get dropped as we expect everyone to work with everyone regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression, if the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, levels gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.

The Role

We're looking for a full stack engineer who is fluent in React/Typescript but comfortable working across the entire stack. This includes building on top of our Go backend as well as working directly with the Kubernetes and Helm APIs. Since Porter is a PaaS that abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes, deeply considered design/architectural decisions are the lifeblood of our platform. The best implementation is not always the most obvious one, so an appetite for rigorously evaluating the tradeoffs of different options is essential.

You will be expected to push critical code on a daily basis while also working on larger features that constantly expand the capabilities of the platform.





We value rate of learning above all else. Full stack experience and fluency with React/TypeScript is expected, but less familiarity with Go/Kubernetes is fine if you're a voracious and self-directed learner. Infrastructure management isn't rocket science, but it does involve thinking and working across multiple levels of abstraction at once. If the idea of wrangling that complexity is exciting and not daunting to you, we'd love to talk. As is the case with most early-stage startups, you should be comfortable with regularly shifting priorities and iterating at a very high (daily) velocity.

Who We Are

Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.

At Roboflow, we’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 1M+ developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.

Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: “Roboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.” We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.

We’re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 63 million from Y Combinator, Google Ventures, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.

We’re looking for strong technical generalists to contribute to our core product and help us build the foundation for our rapidly expanding company.

What We're Looking For

Primarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You’re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You’re eager to ‘do the work,’ big and small.

You’re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.

You’re motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.

Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.

What You'll Do

You'll be tasked with a wide range of projects. Each engineer has a realm they focus on, but we're still small enough that we don't have the luxury of deep specialization. We're looking for technical generalists that aren’t afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises (but JavaScript and Node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase).

Most of the things we work on are parts of the core product (which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment) but from time to time we're also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects.

You'll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to our strategy decisions. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit.

The majority of our codebase is written in JavaScript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some machine learning infrastructure on AWS. We're increasingly using Docker (both internally and for customer facing products like our edge inference server). A lot of our code runs in the browser (including some Tensorflow JS) but we're also working on building APIs and client libraries in several languages.

You certainly don't need to be experienced in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team.

We’re especially keen to add some rigor to our processes and build the foundation for rapidly scaling the engineering organization (for example: we currently have limited tests and are not using an opinionated front-end framework -- things that will need to change over the coming months in order to be able to seamlessly expand the team).

We're gamifying marketing to create engaging interactions that build long-term consumer relationships and boost revenue for restaurants. Our platform serves thousands of restaurants and millions of consumers throughout the U.S. We're seeking engineers for the next stage in our hyper-growth journey: scaling from proven business model to unstoppable force.

The next 12 months of growth at Boostly will be intense and rewarding.\ \



We're building something remarkable. We have a shot to transform how restaurants earn your business and to introduce a new paradigm many more markets will seek to adopt.

We’ve proven our product’s value in the market. Now we’re scaling, refining, and raising the bar for our engineering team—shifting from “make it work” to “make it great.” This role offers the opportunity to shape our frontend architecture while mentoring team members and collaborating across functions to define and implement new features.

Our frontend architecture and user experience are critical to delivering engaging interactions that keep customers coming back. You'll lead frontend development initiatives, establishing patterns and practices that enable our team to build delightful, performant experiences.



You have deep expertise in React and modern JavaScript, with a track record of building consumer-facing web applications at scale. While React is your primary tool, you stay current with the broader frontend ecosystem and can evaluate new technologies pragmatically.

You're well-versed in frontend performance optimization and understand the architectural implications of different state management approaches. You're experienced with modern frontend build tools and testing frameworks, and you understand how to build scalable component systems for the long term.

You have a strong sense for user experience and consider how users will discover, understand, and interact with features. You think through user flows and edge cases, and collaborate with design to create intuitive interfaces.

Ideally, you've scaled applications through rapid growth before, but we're also excited about candidates who combine strong engineering fundamentals with an unstoppable drive to learn and grow.

You think in terms of customer problems, not just technical solutions. When given a business challenge, you can think from first principles to identify core issues and translate high-level objectives into concrete technical decisions. You're comfortable leading these decisions while collaborating with designers, product managers and backend teammates.

You see every teammate as someone you can learn from, someone who'll push you to grow and someone you can teach. You mentor at every opportunity, actively collaborate with peers, and humbly seek guidance from your team.

You're embracing AI and understand how to leverage it as a force multiplier.

Loop is on a mission to streamline the movement of money between shippers, carriers, and brokers to unlock margin and increase liquidity in the supply chain.

Today, logistics payments are a big black box that unnecessarily drains thousands, if not millions, of dollars. Legacy services do not meet the market's needs. Transportation teams need a solution that unlocks insights from their complex datasets, rather than drowning them in manual workflows.

Loop harnesses AI expertise with deep logistics industry knowledge to deliver automated audits, streamlined resolutions, expedited payments, and most importantly actionable insights. All so that shippers and 3PLs can improve spend visibility, eliminate unnecessary costs, and optimize their transportation spend. Loop's customers see a 4% reduction in costs and an 80% boost in back-office productivity.

Loop is a customer-obsessed company that sees the complexity in the supply chain as an opportunity rather than a challenge. Our foundational AI capitalizes on the messiness in the system to maximize outcomes for our customers.

Investors include Founders Fund, 8VC, Susa Ventures, Flexport, and 50 industry-leading angel investors. Our team brings subject matter expertise and experience from companies like Uber, Google, Flexport, Meta, Samsara, Intuit, and Rakuten – as well as traditional logistics companies like CH Robinson.
